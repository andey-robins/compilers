# Program 6

- [x] Verify only one main with return type of void or int and no args
- [ ] Verify `this` is only at the beginning of a dotted name
- [ ] Arithmetic operators all require int operands
  - [ ] This is including the >, <, >=, <= operators
- [ ] Relational operators return (return where?) 1 if true and 0 if false
  - [ ] && and || only take integers
- [ ] The equality operator is the major difference as it can compare any reference to null or another reference type
- [ ] `new` allocates memory for an object (again, where is this alocated?). The type on the right must match the type of the variable on the left
- [ ] `new` can have arrays which are only filled in up to (but not including the last)
- [ ] array return types are valid
- [ ] null is a reference type to an array or class. it cannot be compared to an integer
- [ ] `read()` returns an integer
- [ ] `print()` has a void return type and takes any number of integers
- [ ] constructors may not be called directly
- [ ] a method may not return something if it is a constructor or has the `void` return type
- [ ] methods do not have to have a return statement (even if they have a return type (this is such an unbelievably bad idea, it pains me to allow it))
