Cleaned up and synthesized for obvious reasons.

1. Include header information in every file
2. Don't use a build directory
3. Tab characters don't register the way Buckner intends
4. Remove "quit"
5. Don't use `strcmp()`
6. Do all of the work in flex, not in the C++
   1. Return values other than 1
7. Double check everything on the university build system
   1. Apparently g++ is different/has access to different files on University machines
